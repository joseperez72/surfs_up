## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to make sure W. Avy's investment in the ice cream and surf shop remains profitable throughout the year. For this analysis, we are looking at the statistics for the month of June and the month of December. For this analysis, we are provided with a SQLite file, so we are using SQLAlechemy, Python version 3.9.7, and Jupyter Notebook version 6.4.5.

## Results

- For the month of June, we have a total of 1,700 days to look at. On average, the temperature is 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit, with the lowest temperature recorded at 64 degrees and the highest temperature recorded at 85 degrees.

- For the month of December, we have a total of 1,517 days to look at. On average, the temperature is 71.04 degrees Fahrenheit, with the lowest temperature recorded at 56 degrees and the highest temperature recorded at 83 degrees.

## Summary

After looking at our analysis, we see that the temperatures for both months are fairly similar. With this information, we can conclude that the climate will work for this business. Some queries that will help our analysis and provide a stronger case would be looking at the climate throughout the month. If the weather is cloudy and windy, or constantly raining, then it could make ice cream and surfing less appealing. Another query that can help our analysis is looking at how many ice cream shops are nearby, as well as see how many people surf on a daily basis.
